It starts!  Yay!

essen at Freenode recommended cowboy_examples as a quick to get up and
running Erlang program.  It rocks!  clone, make, ./start.sh and it's

Stupid computer!  It rebooted from having a USB camera connected to

20:35

Sub acquired.

21:03

Program works.  I can go home.  :-)

Unfortunately it shouldn't really be allowed to kill supervisors,
because that breaks one of the Rules of Erlang.  Let's see if I can
identify those.
