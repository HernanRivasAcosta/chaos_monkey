This is The CHAOS MONKEY.  It will kill your processes.

Start by including the chaos_monkey application amongst your
applications.  The chaos_monkey stays in his cage and eats bananas by
default.

chaos_monkey:find_orphans() -> [Pid]

  The Chaos Monkey smell processes and find the ones which don't have
  the protection of an application.  It gladly hands them over to you.


chaos_monkey:on() -> ok
chaos_monkey:off() -> ok

  Asynchronous.

  Will let The Chaos Monkey wreck reasonable havoc over time on your
  system.  This is the command to use if you want The Chaos Monkey
  running all the time.

  It will stay away from system processes and supervisors like a good
  monkey.


chaos_monkey:havoc(Applications) -> {ok, NumberOfKilledProcesses}
chaos_monkey:havoc(Applications, Protected) -> {ok, NumberOfKilledProcesses}

  Types:

    Applications :: all | all_but_otp | all_but_deps | [application()]
    Protected :: [pid() | registered_name()]

  Call is synchronous.

  The Chaos Monkey will randomly walk through processes belonging to
  theli st of applications and kill everything a couple of times.
  Supervisors are too strong for The Chaos Monkey, so it will kill
  their children instead aiming to kill it by going above their
  restart threshold.  The Chaos Monkey is not suicidal so it will
  respect restart thresholds of top level supervisors.

  The Chaos Monkey will stay away from Protected processes, which can
  be protected by name or pid.  System processes and processes
  belonging to the kernel application are always protected, as is
  chaos_monkey itself.  It doesn't like seafood nor snails, so the
  shell is also protected.

  Processes that don't belong to an application or are not part of a
  supervision tree are eaten for lunch.

  Applications decide which applications are available for killing:

    all -- All applications are available for killing.  Only Protected
           processes are safe from The Monkey.

    all_but_otp -- As above, plus stay away from applications in OTP

    all_but_deps -- As above, plus stay away from applications which
                    are only included as dependencies.

    [ListOfApps] -- Sic the Chaos Monkey on the list of application.
                    Remember that the Monkey will always see lonesome
                    processes that don't have the protection of an
                    application as available for harassment.
